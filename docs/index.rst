Paref is a Python package for algorithmic *problem tailored* multi-objective optimization.
This package contains...

* a series of ready-to-use MOO algorithms corresponding to frequently targeted properties

* a framework for you to implement and apply your problem tailored MOO algorithm

* generic and intuitive interfaces for MOO algorithms, black-box functions and more, so solving a MOO problem with user-defined properties with Paref requires only minimal effort

The official release is available at PyPi:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install paref
